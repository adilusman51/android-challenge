Coding challenge: Create a small Android app that takes location data from a server and displays the information.

# Scope
- Use common libraries (for DI, networking etc.) to structure your app. Use Jetpack Compose for the UI.
- Get location data from https://payback-coding-challenge.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/germany.json
- Have on screen that shows one editable textview (to enter search text) and a button to clear the input.
- Below that show a scrollable list of the loaded location data. List items show the name of an item, the address and geo location.
- While typing text into the search textview, the list should be be filtered on the fly and only show items containing the search string.
- Write a unit test for one component of the application.
